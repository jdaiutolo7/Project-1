# Project 1

This project analyzes a dataset that contains information about different AirBnBs throughout New York City. The project uses multiple Jupyter files to read and clean a .csv file into a dataframe and performs data comparisons and analyses using various metrics.

1. The initial Jupyter file does the following:
    
    -Reads a large .gz file into a dataframe
    -Reduces the data into a more manageable dataframe
    -Writes the new dataframe into a .csv file in the Resources folder

2. The three project files do the following:
    
    -Read in the the cleaned .csv file from the Resources folder
    -Further reduce the initial dataframe into multiple smaller dataframes in order to compare and visualize the data
    -Compare Price and popularity of AirBnB units between boroughs
    -Analyze the commonality of size and styles of AirBnBs
    -Analyze trends regarding reviews and ratings of AirBnBs
    -Provide various charts and graphs to aid in data visualization

3. The .ppt file does the following:
    
    -Summarizes the discussion questions
    -Summarizes findings
    -Features graphs from the previous Jupyter files to illustrate data analysis
